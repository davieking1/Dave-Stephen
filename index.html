            <p><strong>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</strong> (or simply PHP) is a server-side scripting language designed for Web development, but also used as a general-purpose programming language. It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP
              reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.</p>
    
            <p>PHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the
              web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be executed
              with a command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to implement standalone graphical applications.</p>
    
            <p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.</p>

            <p>When you learn something new, it is very important to remember basic things about the stuff you're trying to learn. You know, the stuff you quite often omit that are very important. Like:</p>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>Your text file must be saved with ".php" extension. Not with ".php.txt" but with just ".php". This is achieved by choosing option "all files" which is found under field where you type name of the file when you save. Then you add at the end of
              file an extension.</li>
            <li>Every php file i.e code inside it, start with left arrow "&lt;"</li>
            <li>followed by question mark "&quest;"</li>
            <li>then you add to it a string "php" which is followed by one empty space</li>
            <li>which afterwards you can enter your php code.That how servers know it's a php code that it can executes it.</li>
            <li>After you done with coding, make one empty space you, then you should close it with question mark "&quest;" followed with right arrow. "&gt;"</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="alert alert-warning">
            <p>So it goes something like this: <code>&lt;&quest;php //yourPHPCodeGoesHere &quest;&gt;</code></p>
            <p>Ofcourse <code class="cd">&lt;&quest;php</code>, your <code class="cd">code</code> and <code class="cd">&quest;&gt;</code> don't have to be on the same line. You can break it!</p>

            <h3>What is "variable scope":</h3>
            <p>Variable scope is known as its boundary within which it can be visible or accessed from code. In other words, it is the context within which a variable is defined. There are only two scopes available in PHP namely local and global scopes.</p>
          </div>
    
          <ul>
            <li>Local variables (local scope)</li>

            <li>Static variables (local scope)</li>
            <li>Function parameters (local scope)</li>
          </ul>
    
          <div class="alert alert-warning">
            <p>When a variable is accessed outside its scope it will cause PHP error Undefined Variable.</p>

          <div class="alert alert-warning">
            <h3>Local Scope Variables</h3>
            <p>A local scope is a restricted boundary of a variable within which code block it is declared. That block can be a function, class or any conditional span. The variable within this limited local scope is known as the local variable of that specific
              code block.</p>
            <p>The following code block shows a PHP function. We have declared a variable $count inside this function. This variable is said to be a local variable of this function and it is in the local scope of the function block.</p>
          </div>
          <code>
            &lt;&quest;php 
              function calculate_count() {
              $count = 5;
              //will print 5; the value of local variable
              echo $count++; 
              }

          </code>
          <div class="alert alert-warning">
            <p>Local variables will be destroyed once the end of the code block is reached. Hence the same named variables can be declared within different local scopes.</p>

          <div class="alert alert-warning">
            <h3>Global Scope Variables</h3>
            <p>As its name, the global scope provides widespread access to the variable declared in this scope. Variables in global scope can be accessed from anywhere from outside a function or class independent of its boundary.</p>
            <p>PHP global variables can be defined by using <strong>global</strong> keyword. If we want to use global variables inside a function, we have to prefix the global keyword with the variable. The following code shows a code block to learn how to use
              the global keyword with a PHP variable to declared it as a global variable.</p>
          </div>
          <code>
            &lt;&quest;php 
              $count = 0;
              function calculate_count() {
              global $count;
              // will print 0 and increment global variable
              echo $count++ . "&lt;br&gt;";
              }
              calculate_count();
              echo $count;

          </code>
          <div class="alert alert-warning">
            <p>PHP has a predefined <span class="strong">superglobal</span> variable called <strong>$GLOBALS</strong>. It is an associative array with the name of the variable as key and value as the array element. We can use this array variable to add an array
              of PHP variables in a global scope.</p>
            <p>Let us change the above example with the global keyword by using $GLOBALS superglobal to access the variable in global scope.</p>
          </div>
          <code>
            &lt;&quest;php
              $count = 0;
              function calculate_count() {
              // will print 0 and increment global variable declared outside function
              echo $GLOBALS["count"]++ . "&lt;br&sol;&gt;";
              }
              calculate_count();
              echo $count;

          <div class="alert alert-warning">
            <h3>Static Variables (local scope)</h3>
            <p>A static variable is again a variable with local scope. But the difference with the regular local variable is that it is not destroyed outside the scope boundary. A variable can be defined by using the ‘static’ keyword inside a function.</p>
            <p>A static variable <span class="svar">does not lose its value when the program execution goes past the scope boundary</span>. But it can be accessed only within that boundary. Let me demonstrate it using the following example code:
            </p>
          </div>
          <code>
            &lt;&quest;php
              function counter(){
                  static $count = 0;
                  echo $count;
                  $count++;
              }
            &quest;&gt;
          </code>
          <div class="alert alert-warning">
            <p>The above counter function has the static variable ‘count’ declared within its local scope. When the function execution is complete, the static count variable still retains its value for further computation. Every time the counter function is
              called, the value of count is incremented. The count value is initialized only once on the first call.</p>
          </div>
    
          <hr>
          <div class="alert alert-warning">
            <h3>Function Parameters (Local Scope)</h3>
            <p>Function parameters (arguments) are local variables defined within the local scope of the function on which it is used as the argument.</p>
            <h5>Scope and File Includes:</h5>
            <p>The boundary of file includes does not demarcate the scope of variables. The scope of a variable is only governed by the function block and not based on the file include. A variable can be declared in a PHP file and used in another file by using
              ‘include’ or ‘require’ that file.</p>
            <h5>Function Inside Function or Class:</h5>
            <p>Remember that the scope in PHP is governed by a function block. Any new function declared anywhere starts a new scope. If an anonymous function is defined inside another function, the anonymous function has its own local scope.</p>
          </div>
          <code>
            &lt;&quest;php 
              function foo() {
                $fruit = 'apple';
    
                $bar = function () {
                    // $fruit cannot be accessed inside here
                    $animal = 'lion';
                };
    
                // $animal cannot be accessed outside here
            }
            &quest;&gt;
          </code>
          <div class="alert alert-warning">
            <p>In the above example code, $fruit variable is restricted to the outer function and its scope does not span inside the anonymous inner function. The same way, $animal which is declared inside is not accessible in the outer function as its scope
              boundary is restricted to the inner function.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="alert alert-success">
            <h5>General Note:</h5>
            <p>Whenever you want to use a variable in a different scope, the way in and way out is by passing as an argument. Do not use global scoped variable for such trivial use cases.</p>

            <p>Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, until a certain condition is met. The basic idea behind a loop is to automate the repetitive tasks within a program to save the time and effort. PHP supports four different types
              of loops:</p>
          </div>
          <ul>

            <h5>Difference between While and Do…While Loop</h5>
            <p>The while loop differs from the do-while loop in one important way — with a while loop, the condition to be evaluated is tested at the beginning of each loop iteration, so if the conditional expression evaluates to false, the loop will never be
              executed.
            </p>
            <p>With a do-while loop, on the other hand, the loop will always be executed once, even if the conditional expression is false, because the condition is evaluated at the end of the loop iteration rather than the beginning.</p>

            <h3>For Loop</h3>
            <p>The for loop repeats a block of code until a certain condition is met. It is typically used to execute a block of code for certain number of times.</p>
          </div>
          <code>
            for(initialization; condition; increment){
              // Code to be executed
            }
          </code>
          <p>The parameters of for loop have following meanings:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>initialization — it is used to initialize the counter variables, and evaluated once unconditionally before the first execution of the body of the loop.</li>
            <li>condition — in the beginning of each iteration, condition is evaluated. If it evaluates to true, the loop continues and the nested statements are executed. If it evaluates to false, the execution of the loop ends.</li>
            <li>increment — it updates the loop counter with a new value. It is evaluate at the end of each iteration.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The example below defines a loop that starts with $i=1. The loop will continued until $i is less than, or equal to 5. The variable $i will increase by 1 each time the loop runs:</p>
          <code>
            &lt;&quest;php
              for($i=1; $i&lt;=3; $i++){

            <p>Besides PHP's built-in functions, there's also <strong>user defined functions.</strong></p>
            <h3>User defined functions</h3>
            <p>Their main qualities are:</p>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>A function is a block of statements that can be used repeatedly in a program.</li>
            <li>A function will not execute immediately when a page loads.</li>
            <li>A function will be executed by a call to the function.</li>
            <li>Any valid PHP code may appear inside a function, even other functions and class definitions.</li>
            <li>Function can accept arguments and can also return a value "computed" by it.</li>
            <li>A user-defined function declaration starts with the word function.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="alert alert-warning">
            <p>Function names follow the same rules as other labels in PHP. A valid function name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. As a regular expression, it would be expressed thus: [a-zA-Z_\x7f-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x7f-\xff]*.</p>
            <p>Syntax is something like this:</p>
          </div>
          <code>
            &lt;&quest;php 
              function foo($arg_1, $arg_2, /* ..., */ $arg_n){
                  echo "Example function.\n";
                  return $retval;
              }
            &quest;&gt;
          </code>
          <div class="alert alert-warning">
            <p>In the example below, we create a function named "writeMsg()". The opening curly brace ( { ) indicates the beginning of the function code and the closing curly brace ( } ) indicates the end of the function. The function outputs "Hello world!".
              To call the function, just write its name:</p>
          </div>
          <code>
            &lt;&quest;php 
              function writeMsg() {
                  echo "Hello world!";
              }
    
              writeMsg(); // call the function

          <div class="alert alert-warning">
            <h3>PHP Function Arguments</h3>
            <p>Information can be passed to functions through arguments. An argument is just like a variable.</p>
            <p>Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.</p>
            <p>The following example has a function with one argument ($fname). When the familyName() function is called, we also pass along a name (e.g. Jani), and the name is used inside the function, which outputs several different first names, but an equal
              last name:</p>
          </div>
          <code>
            &lt;&quest;php 
              function familyName($fname) {
              echo "$fname Refsnes.&lt;br&gt;";
              }
    
              familyName("Jani");
              familyName("Hege");
              familyName("Stale");
              familyName("Kai Jim");
              familyName("Borge");
            &quest;&gt;

            <p>The following example shows how to use a default parameter. If we call the function setHeight() without arguments it takes the default value as argument:</p>

              setHeight(); // will use the default value of 50
              setHeight(135);
              setHeight(80);

          <code>
            &lt;&quest;php
